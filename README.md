## Our Why?
[We know first-hand](https://www.fastpix.io/company) the challenges of building video products. Building online video can be complex due to the many interconnected elements like infrastructure, codecs, devices, and delivery networks. This complexity often results in longer development times and less reliable user experiences. Our products and features work individually or together. With built-in extensibility, you‚Äôll spend less time engineering and more time scaling your business. 

FastPix API is designed to simplify these challenges, helping developers build next-gen video products and deliver high-quality video quickly and efficiently.
